### Setting up our BIOS:

> **BIOS:** Basic Input/Output System
basic fundamentals of a computer

When you start your computer BIOS is the first software that runs. 

It can identify, test, and configure your computer's hardware and connect it to your operating system.

**Note:** This is called the BOOT process.

**UEFI** ( Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) is similar to BIOS but has other advantages. 
May be something we want to take some time to talk about async. 

In BIOS we:
- Set our date and time in the Date/Time tab.
- In the Security tab we navigated to the `Secure Boot` menu and disabled Secure Boot.

**Look up Secure boot and why it is needed**
- Also in the Security tab we navigated to the `Virtualization` menu and enabled `Intel (R) Virtualization technology` and `VT-d Feature`
- In the Startup tab we navigated to the `Boot` menu and changed the Boot Priority Order.
  1. USB HDD is top priority

To Exit out of the BIOS navigate to the Restart tab and choose `Exit Saving Changes`.
Alternative way to exit and save is to press `F10`

### Next Steps
From here you can try booting your ThinkPad with the USB flash drive. 

When you want to exit type `shutdown` to shutdown the computer and remove usb drive.
